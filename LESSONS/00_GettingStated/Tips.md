# TIPS

1. Jupyter installation  
Ubuntu/Mac: Use native python/pip/pip3 - you can get lattest Tensorflow, which we will discuss in later sessions.  
Windows: Check [anaconda](hppts://aaa.anaconda.com)  
*Anaconda works on ubuntu/mac and usually is much easier to install*


2. Tensorflow  
If you installed environment properly (python/conda) this installation usually should be one command line ie:  
Ubuntu\Mac: `pip install tensorflow`  
Windows: `conda install tensorflow`    
*If you need more details just check [tensorflow webpage](https://www.tensorflow.org)*

3. H2O  
As above default install: `pip install h2o` `conda install h2o`  
More details check documentation on [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai)

4. Python basic
