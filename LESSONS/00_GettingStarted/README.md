# Getting Started with Python 

## GOAL
On complete this lesson you should:
- have properly setup your environment
- install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow and h2o
- know basic python stuff
- define simple python function
- read CSV data files
- do "Hello World" in Tensorflow
- open H2O flow and see it 



# TODO

### Jupyter installation  

**Challenge:**  
First challenge is to install your environment.   
As you can see in this directory there are several ipynb files - those are ipython/jupyter files.
To open/ run them you need to have installed python environment. You should be able to easily run this command:
```
jupyter notebook
```


### Tensorflow  
**Challenge:**  
Using jupyter interface go to [01_TensorFlowHelloWorld.ipynb](01_TensorFlowHelloWorld.ipynb)  
Replace XXX with your name! Run and do screenshot.  
*To make this kernel working you should have installed Tensorflow on you machine*

### H2O  
**Challenge:**  
Open [02_H2O_firstML.ipynb](02_H2O_firstML.ipynb) and follow the steps.   

After runnig H2O to to H2o flow interface and perform tasks specified in notebook steps.

What you will do is: 
- you will open / import data file 
- you can easily split input data into training and validation
- you will build your first "Generalize Linear Model" ML model

NOTE:
- at this stage you can see lots of parameters - no need to do anything about this - you will learn them latter
- model you build is not "best" but we will do it properly in next lessons
- to understand what just happen - you need to go through lessons - but here you'll see example of proper ML framework

EXPLORE MORE:
- click on build model and check different outputs like : training metrics, validation metrics
- run different ML algorithms and compare their output
- click on data and check columns distributions

### Python basic   
**Challenge**  
Open: [03_StartWithPython.ipynb](03_StartWithPython.ipynb)
1. Fix MyName error
2. set it to your name
3. Make sureyou print your name in "Still my name is %s"
4. Provide cube lambda function
