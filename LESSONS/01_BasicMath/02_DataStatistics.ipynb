In the social sciences, a result may be considered \"significant\" if its confidence level is of the order of a two-sigma effect (95%), while in particle physics, there is a convention of a five-sigma effect (99.99994% confidence) being required to qualify as a discovery.\n",

It follows from Chebyshev's Inequality. For unimodal distributions the probability of being within the interval is at least 95%. There may be certain assumptions for a distribution that force this probability to be at least 98%.\n",
