Introduction to basic Math
--------------------------

This should be only basic math that you need to know to finish this lessons.

## GOAL

- be familiar with basic concepts of matrix 
- know basic statistical terms
- know how to find anomaly using statistical "rule of the thumb"
- do initial data scientist task - data cleaning


## TODO 

- [01_BasicMath.ipynb](01_BasicMath.ipynb) - very short introduction to linear algebra (as this is not math survival guide ;-))  just enough to communicate
- [02_DataStatistics.ipynb](02_DataStatistics.ipynb) - intro to few must know statistical terms, mean, median, deviation, outliers, three-sigma rule
- [03_DataCleaning.ipynb](03_DataCleaning.ipynb) - first data science challenge:
    * take a first look at the data
    * see how many missing data points we have
    * figure out why the data is missing
    * drop missing values
    * filling in missing values
