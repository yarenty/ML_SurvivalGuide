Regression
----------

## GOAL

On complete this lesson you should:
- know what is regression problem
- build simple regression algorithm
- be familiar with some initial ML names: mean, RMSE, model,
- use and compare different frameworks to perform same task
- build your first real model
- get familiar with another data manipulation technics: scaling, normalization


# TODO

[01_BasicRegression.ipynb](01_BasicRegression.ipynb) - learn how to build simple regression algorithm
[02_HousePricing.ipynb](02_HousePricing.ipynb) - more advanced "real life" regression 
[03_DataCleaning.ipynb](03_DataCleaning.ipynb) - data scientist task - this time scaling and normalization
