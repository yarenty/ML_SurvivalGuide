# About
This is quick crash course into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
It is based on 2 main books:
 - Ian Goodfellow, Youshua Bengio, Aaron Courville: "Deep Learning" - 2016
 - Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman: "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction", 2017
 - and [deeplearning.ai](http://www.deeplearining.ai) course. 



# Contents  
- lessons about minimum level of math need to introduce one into the field of ML
- lessons about different ML algorithms and reasoning behind
- higher ML 
- intro to popular libraries / technologies:
