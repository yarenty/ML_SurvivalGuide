# About
This is quick crash course into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
It is based on 2 main books:
 - Ian Goodfellow, Youshua Bengio, Aaron Courville: "Deep Learning" - 2016
 - Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman: "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction", 2017
 - and [deeplearning.ai](http://www.deeplearning.ai) course. 



> You need to have a full understanding of the whole stack.   
> And that's where I learned the most myself as well when I was learning this stuff is just implementing it myself from scratch was the most important. 
> It was the piece that I felt gave me the best kind of bang for the buck in terms of understanding.   
> And so that's something that I keep advising people is that you not work with flow or something else.   
> You can work with it once you have written at something yourself on the lowest detail, you understand everything under you,
> and now you are comfortable to. Now, it's possible to use some these frameworks that abstract some of it away from you, 
>  but you know what's under the hood.  
> \[...\] that's what I would advise a lot of people.
